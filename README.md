# Bank-Note-Analysis
In this project, we will classify a banknote as fake or genuine based on the given dataset from UCI machine learning repository which consists of about 1372 rows with 5 columns.  We will be using different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, Multilayer Perceptron  Data Set Information:  Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.  Attribute Information:  variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) entropy of image (continuous) class (integer)
